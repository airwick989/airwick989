### A bit about Me
Hi, I'm Ridwan! I'm a full-stack software developer 🚀 with a passion for web programming 🌎 and a strong interest in data analysis and automating software processes 📊. 
I'm a software engineering graduate from OTU (Ontario Tech University) 👨‍🎓, where I was also a Software Research and Development Technician 👨‍💻. I've worked on projects for IBM, the National Research Council of Canada, and Team Eagle Ltd. Airfield Operations (for more details on these, check out my LinkedIn linked under **Let's connect!**).

I possess thorough technical experience across numerous key projects focused on full-stack web development, mobile development, DevOps engineering, cloud computing, and real-time embedded software. My project tasks included fulfilling an array of use cases, surveying critical parameters, and working within crucial constraints to meet project expectations ✅. 

I have extensive knowledge of key principles that drive successful architecture and I have been able to apply them using numerous relevant languages and software technologies 🛠.

I am highly effective in a collaborative environment and possess excellent communication skills, allowing me to thrive within a large team 🤝.

I am passionate about working with others to engineer novel software and look forward to continuing to develop leading technical solutions ⚙️.
