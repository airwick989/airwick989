### A bit about me
Hi, I'm Ridwan Hossain. I'm a full-stack software developer 🚀 with a passion for web programming 🌎 and a strong interest in data analysis and algorithm design 📊. 
I'm currently a 3rd-year student at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology 👨‍🎓, where I am also a research and development intern 👨‍💻.
I possess thorough technical experience across numerous key projects, where objectives included developing optimal code solutions for a variety of tasks. Tasks included fulfilling an array of use cases, surveying critical parameters, and working within crucial constraints to meet project expectations ✅. 
I have extensive knowledge of key principles that drive successful software development and architecture and have been able to apply them in conjunction with a number of relevant languages and software technologies. I am highly effective in a collaborative environment, where I have taken on the leadership role across a majority of my projects, allowing me to excel in delegating work amongst team members according to strengths and administering strong communication 🤝.
I am passionate about working in a large team to engineer leading software and look forward to continuing to develop high-level technical solutions ⚙️.
