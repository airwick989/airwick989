### A bit about Me
Hi, I'm Ridwan Hossain. I'm a full-stack software developer 🚀 with a passion for web programming 🌎 and a strong interest in data analysis and algorithms 📊. 
I'm currently a 4th-year software engineering student @OTU (Ontario Tech University) 👨‍🎓, where I am also a Software Research and Development Technician 👨‍💻 working on projects in collaboration with IBM and the National Research Council of Canada.

I possess thorough technical experience across numerous key projects focused in full-stack web development, mobile development, DevOps engineering, cloud computing, software engineering, and real-time embedded software. Tasks included fulfilling an array of use cases, surveying critical parameters, and working within crucial constraints to meet project expectations ✅. 

I have extensive knowledge of key principles that drive successful architecture and I have been able to apply them in conjunction with a number of relevant languages and software technologies 🛠.

I am highly effective in a collaborative environment and I possess excellent communication skills which allow me to thrive when working within a large team 🤝.

I am passionate about working with others to engineer leading software and look forward to continuing to develop high-level technical solutions ⚙️.
